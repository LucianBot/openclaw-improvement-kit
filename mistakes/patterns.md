# Recurring Patterns

Track repeated failures here to identify systemic weaknesses. When the same *type* of mistake happens 3+ times, it's a pattern that needs a systemic fix.

## How to Use

When you notice a pattern:

1. **Document it** — Add an entry below
2. **Count occurrences** — Link to relevant mistake IDs
3. **Identify the fix** — What rule/workflow change would prevent this?
4. **Implement** — Make the change
5. **Monitor** — Does the fix actually work?
